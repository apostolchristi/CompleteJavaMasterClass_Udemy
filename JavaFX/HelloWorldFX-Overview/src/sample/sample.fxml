<!-- FXML is a flavor of XML.
 GridPane is one of the JavaFX layouts
 The FX colon Controller atribute tells the runtime which class is the controller for this window. We can see there's package name and .class
 name so sample being the package name controller being our controller class.
 The GridPane doesn't have any child elements and so when we run the application, the window will be empty-->

<?import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane?>

<?import javafx.geometry.Insets?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane?>

<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Label?>
<GridPane fx:controller="sample.Controller"
          xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml" alignment="center" hgap="10" vgap="10">
</GridPane>
